\begin{cvletter}

Recently, at the online job board of the TU Munich I noticed the advertisment of your company NavVis. It has awoken my interest to apply for it, since next summer term I will start my Master's degree studies in the field of \textit{Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence} and I am looking for an opportunity to gain practical knowledge and to apply my technology skills directly into real applications. 

During my Bachelor's degree studies at the Technical University of Munich, which I have finished at the beginning of April in 2016, I increasingly gained pleasure for programming and software development. This is the crucial reason why I apply to you as a Student Software Developer. 
\\I started programming during a part-time job since the 3. semester parallel to my studies, where I worked as a scientific assistant at the chair for Neuroscientific System Theory. One of my works included programming of robots and micro controllers, partially with the use of Linux. The interest for embedded programming has also highly influenced the topic selection of my bachelor thesis, at which I implemented a cryptographic algorithm on an automotive 16-bit micro controller. The work was part of an advanced development for BMW DriveNow and was realized at the company Remes in Erding, where I continued to work as a "System Developer" for a few months in full-time. Thus, I was able to already collect some working experience.
\\Additionally, I accomplished two C++ hands-on lectures during my studies and accepted an offer from the institute for Security in Information Technology to continue as a tutor for one of the C++ lectures, introducing and supporting new students. In my free time I like to read coding theory, especially C++, and seek to learn new technologies. 
    
I have an intrinsic interest to expand and improve my programming skills and to make and apply technology. It would be a great opportunity for me to do so at your company. Thus, I hope to come into consideration for the advertised position and hear from you soon.
\\The earliest possible date for the beginning of the work would be the 20.February. For further questions or additional information I am reachable by the contact details provided on top or rather by a personal meeting.
